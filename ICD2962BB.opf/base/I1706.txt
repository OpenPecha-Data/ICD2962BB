INTRODUCTION
Sog-bzlog-pa Blo-gros-rgyal-mtshan (b. 1552) was born into the famed
Ldong lineage at Gdong-mkhar in Gtsang. From his earliest childhood he mani
fested an inclination towards the Dharma and scholastic learning. He was especially
renowned as a physician and served in this capacity to the Phag-mo-gru princes.
Because of this, he is often called Gong-dkar 'Tsho-byed. He studied with
numerous famed teachers of Tibet. His chief guru, however, was the controversial
Snang-rtse Gter-ston Zhig-po-gling-pa (whose biography appears in the present
volume).
The name Sog-bzlog-pa comes from his tantric victory over the threat of
Mongol invasions through the practice of the Dmag bzlog nyer Inga, a revealed
teaching of Zhig-po-gling-pa.
During his later life he resided at Nyang-smad Skyid-sbug where he
engaged in concentrated meditation.
The writings of Sog-bzlog-pa were famed but extremely rare in Tibet.
Part of the rarity may be explained by the antipathy in which the 5th Dalai Lama
held Sog-bzlog-pa and his teacher. The manuscript from the library of the Ven.
Bdud-'joms Rin-po-che is, unfortunately, incomplete. According to the tho byang
found in the present volume, the present portion is missing the following texts:
1) Ka. Slob dpon chen po Sangs rgyas gnyis pa'i rnam thar yid kyi mun sel.
2) Ca. Sangs rgyas kyi dus chen bzhi'i ngos 'dzin.
The first of these texts is under publication from another separate manu
script. This is a splendid biography of the Guru Padmasambhava. The second
work, alas, has not been reported to exist anywhere in India or Nepal.
